                            combined
                            physics with the history of technology. He worked for several years on issues concerning

                            Much of his research focuses on the structure and role of venture capital and private equity
                            organizations. (This research is collected in three books, The Venture Capital Cycle, The
                            Money of Invention, and Boulevard of Broken Dreams.) He also examines policies towards
                            innovation, and how they impact firm strategies. (The research is discussed in the books
                            Innovation and Its Discontents, The Comingled Code, and the forthcoming Architecture of
                            Innovation.) He co-directs the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Productivity,
                            Research, and Innovation Program and serves as co-editor of their publication, Innovation
                            Policy and the Economy. He founded and runs the Private Capital Research Institute, a
                            non-profit devoted to encouraging data access to and research about venture capital and
                            private equity.

                            In the 1993-94 academic year, he introduced an elective course for second-year MBAs on
                            private equity finance. In recent years, “Venture Capital and Private Equity” has
                            consistently been one of the largest elective courses at Harvard Business School. (The
                            course materials are collected in Venture Capital and Private Equity: A Casebook, now in its
                            fifth edition, and the textbook Private Equity, Venture Capital, and the Financing of
                            Entrepreneurship.) He also teaches a doctoral course on entrepreneurship and in the
                            Owners-Presidents-Managers Program, and organizes executive courses on private equity in
                            Boston and Beijing. He is the winner of the Swedish government’s 2010 Global
                            Entrepreneurship Research Award and has recently been named one of the 100 most influential
                            people in private equity over the past decade by Private Equity International magazine.
