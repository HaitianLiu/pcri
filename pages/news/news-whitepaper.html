        <h2 class="text-center mt-4">Can America Get Its Entrepreneurial Groove Back?</h2>
        <h5 class="text-center">A Discussion about Private Capital's Role in the Economy</h5>

        <p class="mt-5 fw-semibold">Event Overview</p>
        <p>THE PRIVATE CAPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE ("PCRI"), a not-for-profit corporation dedicated to advancing the
            understanding of private capital and its role in the global economy, and the Initiative on Business and
            Public Policy at the Brookings Institution co-hosted on November 15, 2011, an in depth discussion of private
            capital's role in the economy. Entitled Can America Get Its Entrepreneurial Grove Back, the event convened
            leading policy makers, labor, media, academia and the private sector to discuss the role that private
            capital can play in spurring global growth and economic recovery. Speakers included the Administrator of the
            Small Business Administration ("SBA") Karen Mills, New York Times Columnist David Brooks, former Proctor &
            Gamble Chief Executive and Member of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness A.G. Lafley, former
            "Car Czar" Ron Bloom, Harvard Business School Professor Josh Lerner, and Member of the President's Council
            of Economic Advisers Carl Shapiro.
            <br /><br />
            The objective of the program was to bring together a diverse array of thought leaders as part of the
            PCRI-led effort to create more transparency around private capital and its role in the global economy. The
            half-day event in Washington, D.C. was organized as part of the Initiative on Business and Public Policy at
            Brookings. The program featured 18 prominent speakers and focused on four major themes including: (i) the
            state of private capital and its future potential for stimulating economic growth, (ii) the impact of
            regulation and government intervention on the economy, (iii) an update on private capital research, and (iv)
            the drivers of innovation and the role of private equity in stimulating growth.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-5 fw-semibold">Economic Paralysis: Dealing with the Financial Crisis Legacy</p>
        <p>The financial crisis caused a severe shock to the financial system, global trade, and most importantly, to
            consumer confidence. As described by Michael Klein, the former Chairman of Citi Institutional Clients Group,
            this has caused both consumers and corporate executives to view the current economic situation through a
            lens of instability and fear, often referred to as a "financial crisis window." Aaron Chatterji of the Fuqua
            School of Business at Duke University, indicated that widespread uncertainty among executives explains, in
            part, the unprecedented $1.9 trillion of cash being held on corporate balance sheets. While a portion of the
            cash stockpiling may be due to prevailing low interest rates which enable corporations to borrow large sums
            of capital, the broader question remains about what is holding back reinvestment in innovation and other
            expansion initiatives that could create jobs. One possible explanation is regulatory uncertainty caused by
            new legislation, such as Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act. Another cause for inaction: uncertainty
            regarding the prospects for sustained consumer demand. Executives are skeptical about the long-term appetite
            for new products, and therefore are reluctant to invest in costly product development projects. As a result,
            financial institutions and the financial markets have lost confidence, which is further contributing to the
            cycle of stagnation.
            <br /><br />
            New York Times Columnist David Brooks argued that despite feeling the ongoing reverberations precipitated by
            the financial crisis, the U.S. has maintained its fundamental strengths of flexibility and dynamism. Crime,
            domestic violence, teenage pregnancy and teenage suicide rates are declining. America is still a country
            with low-corruption and competitive industries. Most importantly, America maintains its strong social
            networks built on extremely high levels of trust that enable what sociologists call "spontaneous
            sociability". This spontaneous sociability, as described by Brooks, is what enables Americans to build rich
            networks that serve as the foundation for creativity and innovation. Given the strength of the nation's
            fundamentals, the challenge for policy makers and stewards of private capital is how to best capitalize on
            these strengths and become part of the solution. In other words, how can the public and private capital
            sectors work together to accelerate innovation to create more jobs and stimulate growth?
        </p>

        <p class="mt-5 fw-semibold">Government and Its Impact</p>
        <p>As outlined by Brooks, the American political system was formed to cultivate the formation and movement of
            capital and encourage fluid capitalism. During the financial crisis however, the government's role was
            transformed with its decision to aggressively provide capital to support failing private institutions. Post
            financial crisis, which is still a new and uncertain environment, it remains appropriate to consider the
            appropriate role of government in a free economy. Brooks asked whether the government today should be
            "cooking the meal" or "setting the table"?
            <br /><br />
            In the scenario where the policy makers cook the dinner, they take an activist role in the economy including
            providing venture capital or low cost loans to stimulate growth. However, this model faces significant
            challenges due to the large budget deficit. A more viable option would be to have the government "set the
            table" as HBS Professor Josh Lerner described it, thus creating the systems to establish a favorable
            environment for entrepreneurs. For example strengthening,
            intellectual property laws, lowering tax rates and implementing effective immigration policies that entice a
            highlyskilled labor force are all examples of concrete government-sponsored table setting initiatives.
            <br /><br />
            Carl Shapiro of the President's Council on Economic Advisers suggested the correct role of government is to
            provide the proper "ambiance for the meal." Government, according to Shapiro, can ensure that small and
            growing businesses have the access to capital and the tools necessary to thrive. He described three areas to
            improve this ambiance which the Government is currently pursuing. First, in order to provide small,
            high-growth firms with access to capital, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") allows for special
            treatment of seed capital. Government officials are also proposing crowd funding, which would provide a
            limited exemption from SEC registration requirements for companies capable of raising one million dollars.
            Second, government officials are working to expand the limit of Regulation A. Currently Regulation A
            provides an exemption from SEC registration requirements as well as simplified financial disclosure for
            public offerings not exceeding $5 million. Policy makers are proposing to raise this statute to
            include public offerings below $50 million from $5 million, enabling companies to get access to financial
            capital more easily and quickly. Third, officials are designing procedures to streamline compliance with
            cumbersome Sarbanes-Oxley requirements for growing companies, making them proportional and commensurate with
            the age and size of the company. While the government may be doing more than simply setting the table, the
            question remains, what can be done from the demand side to stimulate sustainable growth?
        </p>

        <p class="mt-5 fw-semibold">The Impact of Regulation and Policy</p>
        <p>The question of how policy makers can structure regulation to set the table for expansion and innovation was
            a major area of focus. According to Shapiro, research from institutions like the Kauffman Foundation, which
            seeks a further understanding of the economic impact of entrepreneurship and to improve the environment in
            which entrepreneurs start and grow businesses, play a crucial role in identifying effective policies and
            analyzing their economic impact. The
            research from these "think tanks" shows that among the broad set of small businesses, it is the subset of
            young, highgrowth firms that stimulate innovation and growth. It is the entrepreneur who does not have an
            existing vested stake in maintaining the status quo, who is most often the driving force behind disruptive
            innovation.
            <br /><br />
            Unfortunately, the decline in new business formation and the decrease in number of jobs per new start-up
            since the financial crisis have contributed greatly to innovative stagnation. Small Business Association
            Administrator Karen Mills observed that small businesses account for approximately half of U.S. private
            sector payroll and they have been a major casualty of the financial crisis. Mills estimates that 62% of net
            job losses since March 2007 have occurred in small businesses. To combat this employment destruction, the
            government is actively channeling capital into the hands of small businesses through the SBA. As small
            business loans decreased $105 billion since 2008 and credit standards tightened, the SBA increased its
            lending, reaching an all-time record high of $30 billion in 2011. Similarly, as VC funding fell over the
            same period, the SBA increased its share of SBIC commitments from an average of $0.8 billion from 2006 to
            2009 to $1.8 billion in 2011, while decreasing the time it took for new funds to get licensed.
            <br /><br />
            In addition, the SBA has identified three areas for new job growth. First, the SBA is working to provide
            more small-dollar loans and increase points of access for Main Street small businesses. Second, the SBA will
            provide support for high growth businesses, which is the segment which has been shown to create nearly all
            net new jobs. To prevent a further decline in entrepreneurship rates, the SBA is increasing capital
            commitments through its SBIC funds and crowd-funding, offering mentoring and counseling to build an
            entrepreneurial culture, and enacting policy changes to stimulate innovation through patent reform and
            federal lab commercialization to streamline the grant
            process. Third, the SBA will further support and strengthen small businesses in supply chains through
            low-cost working capital lines of credit and revenue generation support systems. Thus, the government is
            working to design a policy to maximize existing resources to support entrepreneurs by leveraging
            public-private partnerships.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-5 fw-semibold">The Role of Private Capital</p>
        <p>According to Klein, as of 2007 there was $7 trillion of capital raised annually around the world, which
            equates to approximately 20 percent of the relevant GDP in those markets at the time. This infusion of
            capital fueled global expansion, accounting for more than five percent of growth in 100 countries. The
            capital also helped to create great stability and a lower perception of risk within the marketplace.
            <br /><br />
            Even in times of economic challenge, a recovery was spurred by the deployment of capital. Private capital
            enables managers to have visibility across the spectrum of investment opportunities to identify potential
            winners and aligns fiduciary responsibilities with the organization's goals. In addition to investing,
            growing and selling their investments, private equity managers are able to take a long-term view of their
            investments. They can add value including providing strong management teams and financial advice to the
            ventures and have the flexibility to invest in new technologies,
            products, and geographies. Thus, private capital is part of the solution of encouraging and enabling
            economic growth in order to create more jobs.
            <br /><br />
            However, is there enough capital in the system to weather the current economic downturn? According to Klein,
            there is a sufficient capital cushion in the system due to the creation of a new monetary stimulus. This has
            resulted in increased capital raising since the crisis. In addition, the markets have recovered from the
            initial shock, instilling greater
            stability and making capital available at historically low nominal costs. However, the capital has not been
            distributed evenly, with the majority of fixed income raised attributable to government financing. In
            addition, according to Mark Wiseman, the executive vice president of investments at the Canadian Pension
            Plan Investment ("CPPI") Board, another issue is the trend towards "capital protectionism" that is
            preventing the free flow of capital. He explained that capital protectionism serves as an impediment to
            growth and must be addressed similar to trade protectionism.
            <br /><br />
            As a result, firms must work with policy makers to ensure future growth and to promote further innovation.
            Ron Bloom, the former Assistant to the President for Manufacturing Policy, explained that despite the
            overhang of deleveraging and lack of aggregate demand, Americans have not lost the desire to start new
            companies. According to Richard Jaffe of the Association for Corporate Growth ("ACG") Board, much of this
            innovation and growth will come from the middle market companies. The middle market private equity firms
            have the capital and can provide the guidance
            and discipline necessary to help their investments grow. However, per the suggestion of Heather Slavkin, the
            Senior Legal and Policy Advisor for the Office of Investment, firms can ensure greater success by working
            closely with the labor unions and viewing the employees as assets in order to leverage the existing
            knowledge at these companies.
            <br /><br />
            In addition to the middle market, disruptive innovation will also come from the edges of established
            industries and technologies, as explained by A.G. Lafley, the former CEO of Procter & Gamble and current
            Member of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. The goal is to identify opportunities to
            build the associations, the connections and the collaboration that can unleash this disruptive innovation.
            As a result, it is crucial to expand the body of research to identify the winners within private capital and
            establish best practices for the industry to stimulate further investment, innovation, and growth.
        </p>

        <p class="fw-semibold">Key Takeaways</p>
        <p>Despite the current economic turbulence, the U.S. has managed to maintain its fundamental strengths of
            dynamism, flexibility and trust within the social fabric of the country. This coupled with the fact that
            capital is available due to companies' decisions to stockpile cash has created opportunities for investment
            and growth. This growth will be spurred by small businesses, middle market firms, and innovation along the
            edges of existing and established industries. However given the current economic situation, it will be
            critical for these companies to work closely with policy
            makers to identify the role of regulation in stimulating economic growth, whether it is in "table setting"
            or "cooking the meal." As Bloom explained, government and business will likely be locked in a "constant
            dialogue about how they can serve each other and do better together." This dialog will be crucial for
            creating the systems that will enable and encourage innovation. In addition, it will be critical to have
            accurate data and research to assess the effectiveness of these systems, the impact of policy changes, and
            the performance of firms deploying private capital in order to establish industry-wide best practices.</p>

        <p class="fw-semibold">About the Private Capital Research Institute</p>
        <p>
            The PCRI is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation formed to sponsor leading academics and experts to share,
            collaborate and disseminate research on private capital. PCRI's primary goal is to produce high quality
            academic research on the private capital industry based in large part on its comprehensive, centralized
            academic database of private capital transactions. The PCRI will analyze and disseminate its research
            findings to industry experts, policy makers and the public at large.
            <br /><br />
            The first goal of the PCRI is to build comprehensive databases on private capital funds and transactions.
            The PCRI will gather data from two sources: data providers and industry participants. To further this goal,
            since its inception, the PCRI has undertaken the task of gaining access to data from several providers as
            well as asking general partners to voluntarily contribute their data. While this is a daunting task, the
            PCRI initiative has received a great deal of interest and enthusiasm. The PCRI has the support of numerous
            LPs as well as the Institutional Limited Partners Association ("ILPA"). The PCRI will continue to work
            towards building comprehensive, consistent and credible databases to further the ultimate goal of gaining a
            better understanding of the private capital industry. In-depth video and audio content for the
