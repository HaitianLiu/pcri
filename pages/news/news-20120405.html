        <h2 class="text-center mt-4">GPs sign on to private capital database</h2>
        <p class="text-center fst-italic">April 5, 2012</p>
        <p class="mt-5">
            A group of private equity firms including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, The Carlyle Group and Apollo Global
            Management have agreed to contribute transaction and fund information to a database being developed by the
            Private Capital Research Institution.
            The PCRI has been working on the global private capital database since late 2010, which will be stored
            behind a firewall at the National Opinion Research Center, an organization associated with the University of
            Chicago. Led by Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner, the PCRI will collaborate with The Brookings
            Institute to analyse and share its findings with academics, industry players, policymakers and the general
            public.
            <br />
            <br />
            ���When you think about some of the questions that limited partners would want [answered] getting
            dispassionate high quality research going will make a big difference,��� Lerner told Private Equity
            International. ���There are a number of people who are LPs who are on our advisory board who have been quite
            supportive.���
            <br />
            <br />
            A total of 15 GPs have agreed to provide data to the PCRI initiative, including investors in the upper end
            of the market such as Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Thomas H Lee Partners as well as mid-market firms like The
            Riverside Company and Kohlberg & Company. Other fund managers that have agreed to contribute to the database
            include Actis, Apax Partners, Berkshire Partners, Court Square Capital Partners, First Reserve Corporation,
            General Atlantic, New Mountain Capital and Saybrook Corporate Opportunity Funds.
            <br />
            <br />
            The PCRI plans to expand the number of organisations contributing to the database to include a broader
            population sample.
            <br />
            <br />
            ���One of our main focuses is going to be broadening the reach across the middle market much more
            generally,��� Lerner said, adding that the PCRI aims to have the first version of the database ready by the
            fall of 2012.
            <br />
            <br />
            The need for a new private capital database, according to the PCRI, stems from current challenges to
            performing ���highquality academic research��� and ���significant discrepancies across existing
            databases���. Many researchers have also experienced difficulty gaining access to fund and transaction
            information from existing databases.
            <br />
            <br />
            Last September, the Institutional Limited Partners expressed its support for the PCRI database.
            <br />
            <br />
            ���With more data and reports being generated on the subject, it will provide the opportunity for that
            [knowledge] gap to diminish, ILPA executive director Kathy Jeramaz-Larson told Private Equity International
            at the time. ���We support transparency in the asset class between institutional investors and general
            partners, and for the most part, both groups are data oriented,��� she said.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to private equity firms and ILPA, the PCRI has also gained the support of a number of data
            providers, including the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association.
