        <h2 class="text-center mt-4">Buyout firms sign up to share data</h2>
        <p class="text-center fst-italic">by Ayesha Javed, April 5 2012</p>
        <p class="fw-semibold mt-5">The private equity firms' data will be kept under "tight security"</p>
        <p>
            A group of 15 buyout firms have joined forces to launch a new database of private equity transaction and
            fund information in an attempt to help demonstrate private equity’s economic impact.
            <br /><br />
            The Private Capital Research Institute, an organization that compiles industry data for use in academic
            studies, has secured the agreements from the buyout firms and has teamed up with the National Opinion
            Research Center at the University of Chicago, which conducts research for government agencies, non-profit
            agencies and corporations.
            <br /><br />
            The NORC has experience handling sensitive data, said Harvard Business School Professor Josh Lerner, who
            heads the PCRI project. The PCRI said the data would be “anonymized" and kept under “strictly controlled
            circumstances and with tight security”.
            <br /><br />
            Information from the firms will be used along with data from commercial providers that formed the skeleton
            of PCRI's database, which aims to promote academic research of private capital. PCRI is a non-profit
            organization funded by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.
            <br /><br />
            Prominent buyout firms that have signed up with PCRI include Apollo Global Management, Carlyle Group,
            Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, First Reserve and Clayton Dubilier & Rice. Other firms on the list include Actis,
            Apax Partners, Berkshire Partners, Court Square Capital Partners, General Atlantic, Kohlberg & Co, New
            Mountain Capital, Riverside, Saybrook Corporate Opportunity Funds and Thomas H Lee Partners.
            <br /><br />
            Lerner said that collating a thorough data set would help to address policy questions about private equity
            as well as providing better information for limited partners’ – private equity investors – investment
            committees.
            <br /><br />
            The news comes after news this week that Europe’s private equity trade bodies are in talks to combine their
            data, in a move that looks set to create the industry’s first credible pan-European database.
