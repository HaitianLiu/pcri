            Capital</h2>

        <p class="mt-5 fw-semibold">More Firms to Participate in Breakthrough Initiative to Analyze Private Capital���s
            Global Economic Impact</p>
        <p>CAMBRIDGE MA ��� April 4, 2012 ��� The Private Capital Research Institute (PCRI) , a non-profit organization
            that works to further the understanding of the economic impact of private capital through independent
            academic studies, announced today that fifteen leading private capital firms have agreed in principle to
            contribute transaction and fund-level information to a data platform being developed by the PCRI. The
            initial group of alternative asset management managers, buyout funds, development capital investors, and
            growth equity investors includes Actis, Apax Partners, Apollo Global Management, Berkshire Partners, the
            Carlyle Group, Court Square Capital Partners, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, First Reserve Corporation, General
            Atlantic, KKR & Co., Kohlberg & Company, New Mountain Capital, The Riverside Company, Saybrook Corporate
            Opportunity Funds, and Thomas H. Lee Partners.
            <br /> <br />
            The PCRI is an organization led by Harvard Business School Professor Josh Lerner and funded by the Ewing
            Marion Kauffman Foundation. PCRI���s primary goal is to produce high quality academic research on the
            private capital industry based in large part on the comprehensive, centralized academic databases of private
            capital activity that the PCRI is building. Working with The Brookings Institution, the PCRI hopes to
            disseminate the research findings to policy makers and the public at large.
            <br /> <br />
            Professor Lerner stated: ���Currently, the main barrier to performing high quality academic research on the
            private capital industry is the quality of information about transactions and funds. There are significant
            discrepancies across existing data-bases, which make it impossible to replicate and verify research studies.
            In addition, many researchers have difficulty accessing these data-bases. The PCRI seeks to address this
            problem. Once our data bases are constructed, the PCRI will make this data available only to academic
            researchers in anonymized form under strictly controlled circumstances and with tight security.���
            <br /> <br />
            Professor Lerner added: ���We welcome the data from these firms and look forward to securing data
            contributions from more firms around the world in coming months.���
            <br /> <br />
            The PCRI will store the data behind a secure firewall at a research institution. The databases will not be
            publicly available. Academics will need to submit proposals and get approval prior to gaining access to the
            data. Researchers will only be able to analyze the data using software available on site and only permitted
            to download empirical results.
            <br /> <br />
            In addition to these private capital firms, the PCRI has already gained the support of a number of global
            investing organizations, the Institutional Limited Partners Association and several major data providers.
