        <h2 class="text-center">Agrawal and Lerner Research: A Study on the Impact of Private Equity Investments on
            Organized Labor</h2>
        <p class="mt-5">
            While the aggregate employment impact of private equity has been carefully examined, the quality of those
            jobs remains poorly understood. Anecdotally, accounts are plentiful of private equity groups weakening
            unions, reducing pension benefits, and exacerbating work conditions; but there is little systematic evidence
            one way or another.
            <br /><br />
            To undertake this analysis, Professors Ashwini Agrawal at the Stern School of Business at NYU and Josh
            Lerner of Harvard Business School will combine the PCRI database with two other sources of information. The
            first is data from Department of Labor filings about Unfair Labor Practice complaints (a formal process by
            which employees can object to anti-union activity or pressure by employers) and about union elections. These
            data are compiled on the individual establishment levels – i.e., the specific factories, offices, retail
            outlets and other distinct physical locations where business takes place. The second source will be the
            Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) at the U.S. Census Bureau, which tracks employment and earnings across
            the entire nonfarm private sector and contains annual data for about five million firms and six million
            establishments.
            <br /><br />
            Professors Agrawal and Lerner will look at the events prior to and after private equity purchases, in order
            to evaluate the impact of private equity on job quality and labor-management relations. This work will
            enrich our understanding of the impact of private equity investment on the quality of work life in the
            United States.
